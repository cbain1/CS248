 
There are two different types of data 
    - Basic Data types 
        - int
        - double
        - char
        - boolean
    - Reference types (pointer variables)
        - arrays
        - objects 
        - strings
        - "files"/scanner
        ** for reference type variables, you need to both do the pointer bit and the other part, i.e. you need to do scanner cin and also cin=_____**


IN JAVA all arguments to functions are pass by value but... if you have a reference type, you are passing the pointer to the big thing, not the thing itself 
    - reference types pass the pointer reference instead of what it is referencing 
    - basically 
        - using reference types, it works the same way as pass-by-reference 
        - using basic types, it works the same way as pass-by-value

Now we use electricity to pass information stored in binary (0 low voltage, 1 high voltage) to pass information
    - combine wires with gates which then outputs based on a function of inputs 
        - and gates using and, or gates using inclusive or gates, not gates, or exclusive or gates (think truth tables)
    - and, or, and not are enough to build computers

Things we store in computers:
    - numbers
    - letters 
    - strings
    - uhhh everything else 

Gates   
==========D------- and gate
==========)>------ or gate
==========))>----- exclusive or gate
==========|>o----- not gate



Binary 
    - Binary <--> Decimal (base 10)
        - D --> B
            - take the number and divide it by 2 
            - ex. 6
                - 6/2=3 r 0
                - 3/2=1 r 1
                - 1/2=0 r 1
                - binary: 110
            - ex. 17 
                -17/2=8 r 1
                -8/2=4 r 0
                -4/2=2 r 0
                -2/2=1 r 0
                1/2=0 r 1
                binary= 10001
        - B --> D  
            - take the number and split it into a multiplication problem with exponents
            - ex. 10001
                - 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0
                = 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1
            -ex. 1100101
                - 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^0
                - 64+32+4+1 = 101
    - Binary <--> hexadecimal (base 16)
        - B --> H
            - in base 16 we can use: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F 
                - F here is 15
            - 0 = 0000
            - 1 = 0001
            - 2 = 0010
            - 3 = 0011
            - 4 = 0100
            - 5 = 0101
            - 6 = 0110
            - 7 = 0111
            - 8 = 1000
            - 9 = 1001
            - A = 1010
            - B = 1011
            - C = 1100
            - D = 1101
            - E = 1110
            - F = 1111

            - 1100111011001 =  0001 1001 1101 1001 = 19D9
        - H --> B 
            - ABC = 1010 1011 1100
            - 100 = 0001 0000 0000

Subtraction? 
    - 78-39=? 
        - 78+61=139 ---- ignore the 1 becuase it isnt in the storage memory 
    -39147-21860 = ?
        - 39147+78140=17287 --- ignore the 1 
    - But how do we get that second number? 
        - find the number that adds to make it the next highest power of 10

    - in binary == flip all the bits and then add 1
        - 100110-011011=?
            - 100110+100101 = 1001011 ---- ignore the first 1


Terms
    - Class: programmer-defined data type 
        - to define a class you have 2 different pieces:
            - beta members aka variables 
            - member functions/methods aka functions within the class
                - these functions act on the fish class
                - ex. print the fish on the screen
                - there are 4 types of methods:
                    - constructor: this builds the object 
                    - observer/accessor: these don't change the object (i.e. print)
                    - mutators/transformers/setters: these do change the object (i.e. +, -, or =)
                    - iterator: this is something that loops through a collection (i.e. for or while)
    - Object: variable of a class type



    // public means it is usable outside the class
    // private means only in that class
    // protected is only that class and dervided classes
    // static means shared among all objects in a given class AND it exists no matter how many objects of that class exist - inlcuding 0
    // aka static ALWAYS exists

    - Interface: a list of function prototypes (i.e. the return type and the number and type of arguments) 
        - main idea: describes behavior of classes that implement the interface


Computer 

    - Central Processing Unit (CPU) -------BUS-------- (RAM)
        - number of seats on the bus are the bits 
    - Hard drive - connected to the bus by the controller
    - USB -- universal serial bus 
        - serial as opposed to parallel 
    - Running JAVA
        - java is stored on RAM
    - Clock speed 
        - the way that we measure the speed (2GHz)
    - Fetch-execute cycle 
        - fetch --> decode --> execute --> fetch ......

    - Fake computer language learning
        6. a) 368A 
               RXY
            - store the bit pattern found in register R (6) into memory cell whose address is XY (8A)
           b) BADE 
               RXY
            - jump to the instruction located in memory cell XY (DE) if the bit pattern in A is equal to 0. Otherwise continue with normal sequence 
Inheretance
    - parent class (already exists)
    - derived class (child class)
        - what you do here is specift differences from  the parent class
            - has additional stuff and will inherit everything from within the parent class
        - type compatible with the parent
            - i.e. if a function takes an argument of the parent class, you can also plug in an object of the child class and that would work 
        - type-compatible: child can do all parent can, but parent cannot do all child can 
    - you can create chains of inheretance

Algorithm Analysis 
    - algorithm: a series of steps that solves a problem
        - more of an idea than an actual program -- like a generalized program that you could implement in any language
    - How to pick an algorithm?
        - Time? Cost? Memory?
            - what can affect an algorithm speed?
                - hardware, language, experience of the programmer writing the algorithm, compiler, operating system, size of the problem
    - maximum contiguous subsequence sum 
        - given a list of both positive and negative numbers 
        - want to take a continguous (connected) portion of that list (subsequence) and add them together and maximize that sum
            - i.e. -3+-4 is not as good as 7+8
    -Big O notation: describes the growth rate of a function
        - the running time as a function of input size ignoring constant factors and ignore lower-order terms
        - f(n) = O(g(n))
            if f(n) <= c*g(n)
                for a construct c>0
                and for large n 
        - A(n) = running time of alg1 = O(n^3)
        - B(n) = running time of alg2 = O(n^2)
    - Example:
        - f(n) = 3n^2 + 2071n-3
            - so with this you would ignore the 3 and all terms after n^2
    - Big O analysis of alg1 
        - look at comments next to alg1 in the MCSS code
        - all the lines are loops
        - anything above the line is outside the loops
        - anything below the lines is inside the loop

            - 3n^3+6n^2+3n+3

    - Big O for analysis of alg2

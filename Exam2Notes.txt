Applications of Stacks
    - functions are run by a stack 
    - runtime stack
        - where are variables stored?
            - stack (everything else)
            - heap (new)
            - global (static)
    - math is a stack   
        - specifically post fix uses a stack (23+ instead of 2+3)
            - evaluating post-fix
                - scan left to right:
                    if its a number
                        push
                    if operator
                        pop B
                        pop A 
                        push (A op B)
Queue
    - tis like an tube 
    - put stuff in back and remove stuff from front

    ---------------------

    - add stuff: enqueue
    - remove stuff: dequeue
    - getFront
    - isFull
    - isEmpty
    - size
    - makeEmpty 

    - using an array
        - basically position 0 is the front, and the highet position is the back
        - once you dequeue something, just move where the front variable is 
        - if you run over the end, you basically just requeue over stuff you dequeued already 
            - think of this like a donut shaped array
